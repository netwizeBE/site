Commands are not related to an object, but can get or set global properties
or invoke system commands on the device.

## Command Reference

`page` [0-11]

Switches the display to show the objects from a diferent page.

`clearpage` [0-11,254]

Deletes all objects on a given page. If no page number is specified, it clears the current page.

To delete individual objects, you can issue the `p[x].b[y].delete` command.

## Backlight

`dim` [0-100] (alias: `brightness`)

Sets the level of the backlight from 0 to 100%, where 0% is off and 100% is full brightness.

Example: `dim 50` sets the display to half the brightness.

Tip: this can be used in conjunction with the idle event e.g. to dim the backlight after a short period of inactivity.

`light`

Switches the backlight on or off, independent of the set dim level.
Turning the backlight on will restore the brightness to the previous dim level.

Example: `light on` acepted values: on/off, true/false, 0/1, yes/no

Tip: this can be used in conjunction with the idle event, e.g. to turn the backlight off after a long period of inactivity.

Note: The `dim`and `light` command depends on a GPIO pin to be connected to control the the TFT_LED backlight via a transistor.

`wakeup`

Clears the idle state of the device and publishes an `state/idle = OFF` status message. It resets the idle counter as if a touch event occured on the devide. This is helpfull e.g. when you want to wake up the display when an external event has occured, like a PIR motion sensor.

## System commands

`calibrate`

Start on-screen touch calibration.

Note: You need to issue a soft reboot command to save the new calibration settings. If you do a hard reset of the device, the calibration settings will be lost.

`screenshot`

Saves a picture of the current screen to the flash filesystem. You can retrieve it via http://&gt;ip-address&lt;/screenshot.bmp
This can be handy for bug reporting or documentation.

The previous screenshot is overwritten.

`statusupdate`

Reports the status of the MCU. The response will be posted to the state topic:
```json
    "statusupdate": {
        "status": "available",
        "espVersion": "0.0.6",
        "espUptime": 124,
        "signalStrength": -72,
        "haspIP": "10.1.0.148",
        "heapFree": 5912,
        "heapFragmentation": 7,
        "espCore": "2_6_3"
    }
```

`reboot` (alias: `restart`)

Saves any changes in the configuration file and reboots the device.

`factoryreset`

Clear the filesystem and eeprom and reboot the device in its initial state.

Warning: There is no confirmation prompt nor undo function!

## Configuration Settings

### Wifi

`ssid`

Sets network name of the access point to connect to.

`pass`

Sets the optional password for the access point to connect to.

### MQTT

`hostname`

Sets the hostname of the device and mqtt topic for the node to `hasp/<hostname>/`

`mqtthost`

Sets the hostname of the mqtt broker.

`mqttport`

Sets the port of the mqtt broker.

`mqttuser`

Sets the optional username for the mqtt broker.

`mqttpass`

Sets the optional password for the mqtt broker.

### Config/xxx

You can get or set the configuration of a hasp-lvgl submodule in json format.
To get the configuration, the command `config/&gt;submodule&lt;`. 
The result will be published to `hasp/plate35/state/config`. Passwords will be omited from the result.

```
config/wifi
config/mqtt
config/http
config/mdns
config/hasp
config/gui
config/debug
```

To update the configuration simple issue the same command `config/&gt;submodule&lt;` with updated json payload.
